# store the time walk to bus stop in variable a
a = 15
# bus journey takes 1 hr and 15 min and stored in b
b = 1*60 + 15
#Store the total length of time for this commute in a third variable called c
c = a + b
#The drive takes 1 hr and 30 mins while the walk from the car park takes 5 mins. Store these in d and e
d = 1 * 60 + 30
e = 5
#stored the total time of car-based commute in variable f
f = d + e
print(f > c)
#the result is Tru, so f > c

X = True 
Y = False
W = X and Y
print(W)
#W is False
