reflection on practical 6: modelling infections
this practical help us understand the pandemic through computational tools simulate.
what i have learnt:
    stochastic and binomial distribution
    spatial dynamics in 2D models
challenges:
    negative susceptible populations. and it was resolved by enforcing non-negative values
This exercise transformed abstract epidemiological concepts into tangible computational experiments.
