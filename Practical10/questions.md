Line Number in dalys.py
60-71

Result Discussion
By analyzing the dataset and plotting the DALYs data of China over the years, it can be observed that the DALYs in China have been generally decreasing over time. This could be attributed to several factors. China has made remarkable progress in public health infrastructure, such as better access to healthcare services, improved sanitation, and enhanced disease prevention and control measures. Additionally, continuous economic development has led to better living standards, which also contribute to the decline in the disease burden measured by DALYs. However, it's important to note that fluctuations might occur due to specific events like disease outbreaks or policy changes during certain periods. Further analysis could involve comparing China's trend with other countries to gain more insights into the effectiveness of different strategies in reducing the disease burden.
